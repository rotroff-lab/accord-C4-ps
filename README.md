# Prediction of individuals benefitting from intensive glycemia control
### Rotroff Lab 

CT-PS and SCT-PS models developed and applied in the "*A Type 2 Diabetes Subtype Responsive to ACCORD Intensive Glycemia Treatment*" manuscript are shared in this repository. The betas associated with SNPs used in CT-PRS are listed in `Mariam_et_al_ACCORD_C4_CT-PS.csv` while the SCT-PRS model is available as an R object (`Mariam_et_al_ACCORD_C4_SCT-PS.rds`). In addition to these polygenic risk score, an application file has been developed (`apply_prs.Rmd`) which takes plink files as input.
