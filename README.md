# Prediction of individuals benefitting from intensive glycemia control
### Rotroff Lab 

CT-PRS and SCT-PRS models developed and applied in the "NAME" manuscript are shared in this repository. The betas associated with SNPs used in CT-PRS are listed in '*ctPRS_model_beta.csv*' while the SCT-PRS model is available as an R object ('*sct_prs_model.rds*'). In addition to these polygenic risk score, an application file has been developed ('apply_prs.Rmd') which takes plink files as input.
